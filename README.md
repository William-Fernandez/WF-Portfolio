## 👋 Hello, I’m William

I’m William Fernandez—Colombian by birth, self-taught web developer by passion, and currently based in London. This site is my personal portfolio, showcasing everything from code to deployment.

I’ve spent the last months diving into front-end (with a dash of back-end), and this project reflects all the tricks I’ve picked up: speedy tooling, thoughtful design, and rock-solid form handling.

## ✨ What’s Inside

Built from scratch with modern tools, you’ll find:

* **React + Vite:** Instant reloads and super-fast builds.
* **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first styling following the 60-30-10 colour rule.
* **Framer Motion:** Smooth, eye-catching animations.
* **Lenis:** Ultra-fluid scrolling for a premium feel.
* **Contact Form:** Functional via EmailJS, with Google reCAPTCHA to block bots.
* **Form Validation:** Powered by React Hook Form for clear, friendly feedback.
* **Lazy Loading:** Only loads what’s in view, boosting performance.
* **Markdown Support:** Dynamically render content with React Markdown.
* **Smooth Anchors:** Nice in-page navigation courtesy of React Scroll.
* **Image Carousel:** Built with React Slick for polished galleries.
* **Toasts:** Non-intrusive notifications using Sonner.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

These are the star players:

* **React** – For building interactive UIs.
* **Vite** – Rapid dev server and build tool.
* **Tailwind CSS** – For fast, responsive styling.
* **Framer Motion** – Animation library that just works.
* **React Hook Form** – Lightweight, flexible form management.

## ⚙️ Environment Variables

I keep sensitive keys in a `.env` file, for example:

* **EmailJS API key**
* **Google reCAPTCHA site key**

This ensures credentials stay out of version control.

## 🔭 What’s Next

On my roadmap:

1. **Back-end integration** with Node.js/Express to handle data more robustly.
2. **Project case studies** explaining design decisions and challenges.
3. **Testing suite** (unit & integration) for long-term code health.
4. **Accessibility review** to make the site inclusive for all users.

## 🔗 Let’s Connect

I’m keen to join a dynamic team and keep growing. If you need a motivated, quick-learning junior dev who cares about clean code and great UX, I’d love to chat!
